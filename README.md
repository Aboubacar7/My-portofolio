Creating a work portofolio showing skills.

 I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me.
Navigation link are clickabe.
The UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
 I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices.
 I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport.
